<b>This automation uses google drive to extract data from a CV, matches it against a job posting in a database (Airtable in this case) and sends an email to HR for the next steps in the screening process.

<h2>Three key advantages of a Smart Candidate Screening Automation:</h2>

1. Significant Time and Cost Savings: Automated screening can reduce initial resume review time by 75-90%, allowing recruiters to focus on high-value activities like candidate interviews and relationship building.
2. Enhanced Consistency and Compliance: Automation ensures every candidate is evaluated using the same criteria and screening questions, eliminating human bias and inconsistencies that can lead to poor hiring decisions or legal compliance issues.
3. Improved Candidate Experience and Quality: Automated systems can provide immediate responses to applicants and streamline the application process, leading to higher candidate satisfaction and reduced drop-off rates.
